**Staff Member Consulted**: Steven Blott  

### Description  
Our project is about refining and implementing technology that allows people to prove that they've met someone in person or been at a specific location. This technology could be used in professional ways such as the healthcare industry (doctor’s appointments, pharmacy prescriptions, etc.) or in more casual ways such as hobby groups.

To implement this technology, our ideas include using QR codes, Live location/GPS, and NFC cards to verify that someone is currently at a location or with another person.

Our current idea is to demonstrate this through a social networking app where a user can only add other people when they’re both together in person. A user can post updates on the app, which are directly linked to their current or past locations. We were also thinking of including games where users could play in person and through their location, such as Pokémon Go.

### Division of Work  
We will divide the work in sprints every week. At the end of the week, we’ll have a review and then divide the work again based on what went well last week and work on anything that has fallen behind.

### Programming Languages  
- NFC configuration can be done with C, Java, or Python.  
- QR codes and the frontend will be designed with Javascript, CSS, and HTML.  
- Backend programming will be done with Python and Javascript.  
- Database management and configuration will be done with Python and SQL.  

### Programming Tools  
- Django  
- SQL Database  
- Online NFC card configuration tool(s)  
- Online QR code configuration tool(s)  

### Learning Challenges  
- Learning how QR codes and NFC cards work and how they could be properly implemented in our design.  
- Learning how to obtain GPS/Location data from phones and how to use it.  

### Hardware/Software Platform  
- PC; Windows  

### Special Hardware/Software Requirements  
- NFC cards (obtainable online)  
- Working phones with NFC readers
